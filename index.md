  <p>Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.</p>

In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence and data-driven decision making, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between fundamental understanding and modern computational methods. Whether it's unraveling the mysteries of the universe or building intelligent systems, I believe the best solutions come from combining rigorous analytical thinking with cutting-edge technology.

## About Me

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; align-items: flex-start; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
    <p>I am Ph.D. candidate in Physics at Southern Methodist University, with a strong background in both theoretical and applied physics, as well as extensive experience in software development and data engineering. My journey began with a B.S. in Physics from the University of Texas at Dallas, followed by three years as a Big Data Engineer at L3 Technologies, where I honed my skills in building scalable data pipelines and microservice architectures. Now, as a researcher, I focus on leveraging machine learning techniques to tackle complex problems in cosmology and particle physics, aiming to uncover new insights about the fundamental nature of reality.</p>

    <p>I am now looking forward to graduating in May 2026 and continuing my journey of discovery, and learning.</p>

    <p>Have you ever wondered how the universe began? What the most fundamental building blocks of matter are? My research delves into the mysteries of the cosmos, exploring the fundamental forces that shaped our existence.</p>
    <p>By combining advanced machine learning techniques with cutting-edge physics, I am analyzing cosmic microwave background to determine the initial matter distribution at the Big Bang. This will give us clear insights into the early universe's conditions and the formation of large-scale structures. I am also using Neural Networks to probe the proton under extreme conditions in which the quark-gluon plasma is formed and fully saturated with gluons, revealing the intricate dynamics of matter.</p>
