  <p>Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.</p>

In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence and data-driven decision making, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between fundamental understanding and modern computational methods. Whether it's unraveling the mysteries of the universe or building intelligent systems, I believe the best solutions come from combining rigorous analytical thinking with cutting-edge technology.

## About Me

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; align-items: flex-start; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
    <p>I am Ph.D. candidate in Physics at Southern Methodist University, with a strong background in both theoretical and applied physics, as well as extensive experience in software development and data engineering. My journey began with a B.S. in Physics from the University of Texas at Dallas, followed by three years as a Big Data Engineer at L3 Technologies, where I honed my skills in building scalable data pipelines and microservice architectures. Now, as a researcher, I focus on leveraging machine learning techniques to tackle complex problems in cosmology and particle physics, aiming to uncover new insights about the fundamental nature of reality.</p>

    <p>I am now looking forward to graduating in May 2026 and continuing my journey of discovery.</p>

    <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of particle physics, machine learning, and cosmology. I am particularly focused on using advanced statistical methods to analyze high-energy physics data and improve our understanding of fundamental interactions. My work focuses on developing models that are able to push the limits of current methodologies, providing new insights into the underlying physics.</p>
