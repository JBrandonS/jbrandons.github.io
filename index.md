  <p>Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.</p>

In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence and data-driven decision making, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between fundamental understanding and modern computational methods. Whether it's unraveling the mysteries of the universe or building intelligent systems, I believe the best solutions come from combining rigorous analytical thinking with cutting-edge technology.

## Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of particle physics, machine learning, and cosmology. I am particularly focused on using advanced statistical methods to analyze high-energy physics data and improve our understanding of fundamental interactions.

    <h3>Primordial Non-Gaussianity</h3>
    <p>Ever wondered why we exist? My work explores the early universe's conditions that led to the large-scale structure we observe today. By analyzing CMB data using Machine Learning, I aim to uncover the statistical properties of primordial fluctuations to levels never before achieved.</p>

    <p>Does the proton actually look like a bunch of balls close together? It turns out it doesn't! My research focuses on understanding matter's structure through DIS in the color dipole picture, exploring gluon saturation and quark-gluon plasma.</p>
