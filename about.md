    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Born and raised in Dallas, TX, I have always been fascinated by technology and science. From a young age, I found myself taking apart every TV, washing machine, remote-controlled car, and electronic device I could get my hands on to understand how they worked. This curiosity led me to teach myself programming at the age of 12 and, eventually, while writing a physics engine for a game I wanted to create, I developed a love for understanding how the world operates.</p>

    <p>These interests encouraged me to obtain a B.S. in Physics from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2016. During my time there, I participated in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in China, studying the journey from weak interaction to the Higgs boson, and completed my final project on galaxy cluster mergers under the guidance of Dr. King.</p>

    <p>After graduating, I utilized my quick thinking and programming skills as a Big Data Engineer for L3, one of the largest defense contractors in the world. In this role, I worked on a fast-paced program aimed at aiding the military with rapid responses to active threats. I built data pipelines to handle billions of transactions per hour, designed microservice architectures for rapid development, and developed tools to streamline data processing and analysis. However, my desire to deepen my understanding of the physical world never waned.</p>

    <p>After three years at L3 and feeling that I had learned all I could in that position, I decided to return to academia to pursue a Ph.D. in Physics at Southern Methodist University. There, I have engaged in numerous projects that leverage machine learning to enhance advanced computations on physics data. My research spans from understanding the initial conditions of the universe via the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to exploring the fine-grained details of gluon saturation, all with the aim of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.</p>

    <p>Graduating in May 2026, I am eager to continue my journey of discovery, combining my passion for technology and understanding to what ever path life may take me. I hope to never stop learning.</p>
